# Books

Books is a simple react native app with context API and Redux store -commented-.  
In this APP, I used Expo to develop the react native app and for the state management, I used context API and redux to show how I deal with both but commented redux.  
I create photos upload through gallery and camera.  
Add books screen and styling as UI needs more refactor.  
I separate style sheets to make them more separated and if there is an Android or IOS style we can separate them into an individual file also.  
Components folder can be more organized if the project is much complicated into shared components as -Atoms-, molecules, and organism.
The book name is the only required field in the form as in the API.
